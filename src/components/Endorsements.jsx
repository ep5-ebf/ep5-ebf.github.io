            "In the history of science, a number of women have made outstanding and crucial contributions to society's progress and our understanding of the world. . .
            Society has great demand for scientists and engineers, and that is increasing as we become more technologically advanced. We need to get many more women interested and motivated to go into the sciences and related engineering.
            This points out the need for and value of a documentary such as 'Equal . . . But Different'”

            ". . . In my work, I have interviewed thousands of young women. Most of them express that they do not feel a sexist barrier that prohibits any professional training choice for them. So, if the glass ceiling is shattered and the doors are open, why aren’t more women walking through them? And, even more troubling, once they do walk through, why is the drop out rate so much higher for women than men?
            I can think of no better forum in which to ask these critical questions and seek a meaningful understanding of the issues and what to do about them than public broadcasting."

            "Science has never been a single-gender enterprise. Throughout history, women have labored along with men to uncover the secrets of the universe. . . Yet, there are massive divides that continue to create an environment that favors men over women. . .
            Education is the best tool at our disposal to bring more equality to the sciences. I hope that this radio documentary project will play a part in the educational process, helping people understand the important work that women in science have done through the ages, and so that the names of female scientists will jump to peoples' lips more readily."

            "Education of women and girls is the paramount issue of our time. . .
            As founding principal of Young Women’s College Prep Charter School, I am working daily to ensure that we provide a college-ready student who is able to defy stereotypes, take risks, and persevere in science and mathematics. We support ep5 in the endeavor to communicate the need to raise the issue of equity in participation in the sciences and are proud to partner with ep5 on this project. Only by raising awareness and creating strong interest in the fields of science and mathematics will we see women contributing to these fields in greater numbers."

            "There is broad awareness among different stakeholders that there is a shortage of women in STEM disciplines and that America will face serious economic consequences if this is unaddressed. . .
            The compelling need is to understand why the proven research-based solutions and best practices to addressing this problem are not embraced and implemented on a large scale across different segments. Unless we understand our reluctance to implement proven solutions, this will remain an academic discussion. A documentary that gets to the core of this issue is long overdue and, frankly, is missing in our national dialogue."

            "[I] express my support of the DUNE RIDER! series, and my interest in directing it. . . I see terrific possibilities in this show – the potential to something to create something fun, inspirational, visually gripping and as an end result – educational. . .
            I think there’s enormous opportunity to build something amazing for younger viewers that will engage them and invigorate their interests in science, engineering, automotives and of course – dune riders."
